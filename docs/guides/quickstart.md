# Quick Start Guide

## Introduction to The Oberon Project

Welcome to The Oberon Project, an advanced SDK for designing next-generation UCAVs using biomimetic principles and neuromorphic computing. This guide will help you get started quickly with the essential components and workflows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)

### Basic Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/oberon.git 
cd oberon
pip install -e .

###  Core Concepts

### Biomimetic Design Principles
The Oberon Project implements biological principles in aerial vehicle design, focusing on:
- Neural-inspired control systems
- Adaptive learning mechanisms
- Energy-efficient operation
- Biomechanical movement patterns

### Component Architecture
The SDK uses a modular approach with these key components:
- **Neuromorphic Core**: Spiking neural networks for decision-making
- **Biomimetic Control**: Nature-inspired flight control algorithms
- **Simulation Environment**: Testing and validation tools
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer**: Interface with various hardware platforms


### End-to-End Design Process
1. Define requirements using the specification tool
2. Design initial control architecture
3. Train neuromorphic models on simulation data
4. Test in virtual environment
5. Deploy to hardware testbed
6. Iterate based on performance metrics

### Adaptive Learning Implementation
1. Configure the learning parameters
2. Set up reinforcement learning environment
3. Define reward functions based on mission objectives
4. Train the model through simulated missions
5. Validate learning outcomes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Simulation crashes**: Check GPU memory usage and reduce model complexity
- **Training instability**: Adjust learning rates and batch sizes
- **Hardware compatibility**: Verify supported platforms in documentation
