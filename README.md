# The Oberon Project

A comprehensive software development kit for the end-to-end design and implementation of advanced, cutting-edge Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) that integrate biological principles directly on neuromorphic hardware.

## Overview

This SDK provides a complete framework for developing next-generation UCAVs that leverage neuromorphic computing and biomimetic principles throughout the entire design lifecycle. From conceptualization to deployment, the framework enables engineers to create highly efficient, adaptive, and autonomous aerial systems inspired by nature's most successful designs. The SDK emphasizes ethical considerations and safety protocols at every stage of the development process.

## Features

- **End-to-End Design Pipeline**: Comprehensive tools covering conceptual design, simulation, prototyping, and deployment
- **Neuromorphic Computing**: Spiking Neural Network implementations optimized for UCAV control systems
- **Biomimetic Control**: Nature-inspired control algorithms that mimic biological systems for efficient flight dynamics
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular design approach for highly customizable UCAV configurations
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Support for various neuromorphic processors and hardware platforms
- **Ethical Governance**: Built-in ethical constraints and safety verification mechanisms
- **Simulation Environment**: Advanced simulation tools for testing and validation in virtual environments
- **Adaptive Learning**: Bio-inspired learning algorithms for in-flight adaptation and optimization
